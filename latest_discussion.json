      "text": "To provide an accurate analysis of the primary trend and identify key support and resistance levels for a current price of $97,450.00, we need to consider several factors including historical price data, technical indicators, market sentiment, and broader economic conditions. Since specific historical context is not provided, I'll outline a general approach:\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Primary Trend\nThe primary trend can be determined by analyzing longer-term charts (e.g., weekly or monthly). Look for higher highs and higher lows to confirm an uptrend, lower lows and lower highs to confirm a downtrend, and overlapping price ranges to indicate consolidation.\n\n- **Uptrend**: If $97,450.00 is part of a series of higher highs and higher lows over the past few months, it suggests an ongoing uptrend.\n- **Downtrend**: Conversely, if this price level is part of a series of lower highs and lower lows, it indicates a downtrend"

If the price is above its moving averages, it suggests bullish momentum.\n* **Relative Strength Index (RSI):**  An RSI reading above 70 indicates overbought conditions, while a reading below 30 suggests oversold conditions. This can help identify potential reversals.\n* **MACD:** The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) can signal buy/sell opportunities and trend changes. Look for crossovers of the MACD lines and its signal line.\n\n**Step 3: Market Sentiment**\n\n* **News & Headlines:**  Monitor"
